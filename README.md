# E-Commerce-Website
A full-stack e-commerce website is developed using the MERN stack: React JS for the front end, and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the back end. The React JS-based front end will feature pages for displaying products, managing a shopping cart, and handling user login and registration.On the back end, Express and Node.js will be used to create APIs for various functionalities, including adding, displaying, and updating products, managing cart items, and handling user login and registration. Additionally, an admin panel will be built to allow administrators to add and update products on the e-commerce site.
